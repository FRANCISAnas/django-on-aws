AWS Deployment
- add dev/prod variable (to be route53 subdomain? [dev, prod]) to delete/retain postgres database and s3 buckets - add it to the makefile with the stackdeletion security flag if prod
- use codedeploy environment variables just to print "dev" or "prod" on the html page
- use case for scheduled lambda AWS::Events::Rule ? (eg. terminate instanceÂ randomly for dev stack)
- use the Well Architected Tool
- test rds snapshots when deleting stack and then restore it

- when everything looks good, replace the sample apache server with the django app (docker)
- add django logs + metrics filtering to CW dashboard
- review failover html page

Application features
- use of metric filter - eg. if too many 404 over 5mn -> trigger alarm (devops alarm)
- Use the DynamoDB streams + SNS/SQS queue for email/slack notifications on new posts, and user welcome email
- Worker tier: push data from django app to an SQS Queue with Lambda workers defined with AWS SAM
- Session data: Configure Django app to work with ElastiCache
- Try AWS Cognito for Users management and SSO
- use S3 event for notifications on new image / object created + sqs & put metadata to dynamodb?

Extras
- create custom metrics for failed/successful deployment and create pie chart in cw dashboard
- define/refine Cloudfront caching strategy: Check/update cache based on Headers, Cookies, or Query string parameters
- Use CodeDeploy blue/green deployment types to "replace" the whole TG with new fresh instances instead of in_place deployment
- Remove open CidrIPs below - and have Lambda to dynamically update with CF public IPs
