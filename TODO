TODOs
- Session data: Configure Django app to work with ElastiCache - session managed by a cookie, forwarded by CF

- Use the DynamoDB streams + SNS/SQS queue for email/slack notifications on new posts, and user welcome email
- Update README (with screenshots of eg, the dashboard), update architecture diagram?
- update ci/cd pipeline

Extras

- define/refine Cloudfront caching strategy: Check/update cache based on Headers, Cookies, or Query string parameters
- Use CodeDeploy blue/green deployment types to "replace" the whole TG with new fresh instances instead of in_place deployment
- Remove open CidrIPs below - and have Lambda to dynamically update with CF public IPs
# https://aws.amazon.com/blogs/security/automatically-update-security-groups-for-amazon-cloudfront-ip-ranges-using-aws-lambda/
- Worker tier: push data from django app to an SQS Queue with Lambda workers defined with AWS SAM
- use S3 event for notifications on new image / object created + sqs & put metadata to dynamodb?
