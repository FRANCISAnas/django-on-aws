Manual steps / prerequisites before launching cfn template:
- Route53 Hosted Zone
- ACM with loaded SSL certificate*, certificate must be both in eu-west-2 for ALB, and us-east-1 for CFN (2 different arns)
- SSM Parameter store to store
    - CW Agent config file (JSON)
    - rds password
    - slack incoming webhook (to forward sns notifications from CodeDeploy/ASG to slack)

* free SSL certificate for ACM (3 months validity) https://itnext.io/using-letsencrypt-ssl-certificates-in-aws-certificate-manager-c2bc3c6ae10

AWS Deployment
- define DR strategy
- make ALB only accessible by CF, and R53->CF?
- SA Pro 490 - S3 event -> Lambda -> write metadata to DynDB + indexed by ElasticSearch
- create architecture diagram
- review AWS notes for any missing service
- add sqs/lambda to mock post message to slack from ec2 instance?
- add bucket for app static resources?
- think about ci/cd pipeline - how to get variables (postgres & redis host) from cfn outputs into codedeploy scripts

- review courses on ASG, ALB + all resources configurations, rename variables for consistency, simplify, add comments, descriptions, etc
(for SSM DB Password, must retrieved it dynamically within app with python sdk)
- use of nested stack and best practices: eg: split R53 / ALB / CF-S3 / NETWORK+SGs?
- prod var to be used to retain/snapshot resources: RDS, S3
- define codedeploy/cicd strategy to managed dev/prod pipelines
- when everything working, try with portfolio docker app

Application features
- Use SNS for email notifications on new posts
- Use CF/S3 for django static and media files 
- Worker tier: push data from django app to an SQS Queue with Lambda workers defined with AWS SAM
- Session data: Configure Django app to work with ElastiCache (unless use API Gateway in front of ELB?) or DynamoDB/Streams
- Configure django to use AWS Cognito for Users management and SSO
- Define S3 buckets: CI/CD artifacts, Django static files, Postgres dump, Logs, etc.
