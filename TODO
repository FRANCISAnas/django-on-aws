Manual steps prerequisite before launching cfn template:
- Route53 Hosted Zone
- ACM with loaded SSL certificate, certificate must be both in eu-west-2 for ALB, and us-east-1 for CFN (2 different arns)
- SSM Paremeter to store CW Agent config file (JSON)


AWS Deployment
- Configure CloudFormation network templates: custom VPC, public/private subnets, SGs,...
- Configure CloudFormation application templates: Elastic Beanstalk, ECS or ALB+ASG (spot fleet with 1 t2.micro?), API GTW, S3
- Define infra configurations (eg. schedule, failovers, etc.) and DR strategy
- Configure SSL on RDS Postgres database and/or private subnet deployment
- Define S3 buckets: CI/CD artifacts, Django static files, Postgres dump, Logs, etc.

Application features
- Use SNS for email notifications on new posts
- Use CF/S3 for django static and media files 
- Worker tier: push data from django app to an SQS Queue with Lambda workers defined with AWS SAM
- Session data: Configure Django app to work with ElastiCache (unless use API Gateway in front of ELB?) or DynamoDB/Streams
- Configure django to use AWS Cognito for Users management and SSO

Cfn / app:
AutoScalingScheduledAction.yaml:
- deploy apache server with CodeDeploy
- convert codedeploy helpers into proper scripts?
- create architecture diagram
- aws courses on ASG, ALB + look at all resources configurations and add comments
- log ec2 terminal commands to CW
- add private network and add rds to private network (for SSM DB Password, must retrieved it dynamically within app with python sdk)
- review all resources configurations, rename variables for consistency, simplify, add comments, descriptions, etc
- use of nested stack and best practices: eg: split R53 / ALB / CF-S3 / NETWORK+SGs?
- when everything working, try with portfolio docker app
- MUST use CodeDeploy for new app version to be updated across existing instances?
- connect to private RDS 
- define DR strategy


Create free SSL certificate for ACM (valid for 3 months)
