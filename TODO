- Simplify as per readme
- redefine deployment commands and CI/CD pipeline
- fix all tests (images with path issue, email notifications functions + general improvements)
    - review all tests, adops the # Given, When Then, and use of tmp_path
- look for all comments # and remove/address them
- Keep AWS deployment and external services integrations for later 
- unit tests requires postgres to run -> handles this for CI pipeline.. still needs a docker compose file after all?
- fix all imports to be absolute
